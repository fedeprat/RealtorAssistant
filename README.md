This is an app I've made for my brother who is a real state agent. He once said to me he did not have a way to easily make photo compilations to upload to his instagram
stories and whatsapp status to advertise the houses. So I thought it would be a good idea to make an app for that purpose.

<br>
  I used the following libraries and technologies to develope it: <br>
    - TypeScript <br>
    - ImagePicker to administrate permissions and image upload to the app <br>
    - React Native Elements to get a hand with checkboxes and inputs <br>
    - Keyboard Aware Scroll View to help with keyboard behavior <br> 
    - React native safe area context to avoid the problematic differences between the top side screen of each device <br> 
    - React redux to manage the global state <br>
    - React Native Navigate to navigate between elements and screens <br>
    
   ![overAll](appPictures/overAll.jpg) This is the Home Screen where you can edit everything to your liking <br>
   ![titleModal](appPictures/titleModal.jpg) If you tap the title or subtitle a modal will pop up to offer you different configuration options <br>
   ![houseFeature](appPictures/HouseFeatures.jpg) If you tap on the middle white center a modal will pop up with checkboxes, you can check all the options you
   want to show <br>
   ![Finished](appPictures/Finished.jpg) This is how it looks after you set everything up. It has the 1080x1920 size recommended for instagram stories and Whatsapp Status. <br>
       Ivan Prat is my brother by the way haha
